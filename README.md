# EE461 Project Blog: AI-Based Load Forecasting

## 📅 Week 6: Project Introduction

This week, we began working on load forecasting using smart meter data from a garment factory in Valelevu, Suva. The main objectives were to:
- Understand the dataset features (voltage, current, energy)
- Explore the goal of the project
- Set up GitHub to document progress

## ✅ Tasks Completed:
- Created GitHub repository for blogging
- Collected and reviewed the smart meter dataset
- Identified key parameters (energy delta, current L1–L3, etc.)

## 📝 Next Steps:
- Start with data preprocessing
- Clean and normalize the dataset

Stay tuned for next week's update!
