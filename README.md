# EE461 Project Blog: AI-Based Load Forecasting

## üìÖ Week 6: Project Introduction

This week, we began working on load forecasting using smart meter data from a garment factory in Valelevu, Suva. The main objectives were to:
- Understand the dataset features (voltage, current, energy)
- Explore the goal of the project
- Set up GitHub to document progress

## ‚úÖ Tasks Completed:
- Created GitHub repository for blogging
- Collected and reviewed the smart meter dataset
- Identified key parameters (energy delta, current L1‚ÄìL3, etc.)

## üìù Next Steps:
- Start with data preprocessing
- Clean and normalize the dataset

## üìä Data Preprocessing & Active Power Visualization

This week, we focused on **preprocessing the electrical load data** collected from the smart meter at the garment factory in Valelevu, Suva. The main goal was to clean and prepare the dataset for modeling, while beginning to explore the relationship between time and active power consumption.
 
### üìà Visualization:
We created a **scatter plot** of **active power** over time to identify usage patterns. This helped us observe:
- Peak usage hours during the day (mostly between 8am‚Äì5pm)
- Sudden spikes in power usage (possibly during machine start-ups)
- Flat or low-usage periods (before or after working hours)
### üìà Scatter Plot of Active Power Over Time

We used MATLAB to create a scatter plot showing how active energy consumption increased from **July 2023 to March 2025**.

## üîå Week 6: Visualizing Three-Phase Currents Over Time

These plots help us understand:
- **How electrical load varies across all three phases**
- Whether there is any **imbalance** in current distribution
- The **pattern of current usage** throughout working hours

When working with real-world power load datasets‚Äîlike those collected from smart meters or industrial monitoring systems‚Äîit's crucial to clean and prepare the data before diving into analysis. In this post, we‚Äôll walk through a practical MATLAB script that does just that: it removes missing values, filters out outliers, standardizes the data, and then visualizes each parameter over time.
```
%% Step 1: Remove rows with missing values
cleanData = rmmissing(LoadDataset)
%% Step 2: Extract numeric data (exclude the Datetime column)
numericData = cleanData{:, 2:end}
%% Step 3: Standardize the numeric values (z-score)
standardizedData = zscore(numericData)
%% Step 4: Remove outliers (keep rows where all z-scores are between -3 and +3)
noOutliersIdx = all(abs(standardizedData) <= 3, 2);
finalData = cleanData(noOutliersIdx, :)
%% Step 0: Rename columns correctly (based on your dataset)
finalData.Properties.VariableNames = { ...
    'Datetime', 'ActivePower', 'VoltageL1', 'VoltageL2', 'VoltageL3', ...
    'CurrentL1', 'CurrentL2', 'CurrentL3'};

%% Step 1: Get variable names (excluding 'Datetime')
varNames = finalData.Properties.VariableNames(2:end);

%% Step 2: Loop through and plot each variable
for i = 1:length(varNames)
    figure;
    plot(finalData.Datetime, finalData{:, varNames{i}}, 'LineWidth', 1.2);
    title(['Cleaned Plot of ', varNames{i}, ' over Time']);
    xlabel('Time');
    ylabel(varNames{i});
    grid on;
    drawnow;
    pause(0.5);  % Optional pause to ensure rendering
end
```

üîç Visualizing the Cleaned Power Load Data
Once the dataset was cleaned and outliers were removed, we visualized the key electrical parameters ‚Äî Active Power, Voltage (L1, L2, L3), and Current (L1, L2, L3) ‚Äî to better understand how the system performed over time.

‚ö° Active Power Trends
The plot of Active Power over time shows a dynamic and fluctuating load profile across the entire observation period. While most values remain within a high range, there are clear dips in power consumption ‚Äî likely due to low-demand periods or operational shutdowns. The cleaned plot provides a more accurate reflection of real usage patterns, making it suitable for further forecasting or energy management analysis.

üîå Voltage Stability
All three phase voltages (VoltageL1, VoltageL2, VoltageL3) remained relatively stable, hovering around the 250V mark, which indicates a healthy supply system. The one noticeable dip around early 2024 could be attributed to a brief fault or sensor issue, but otherwise, the data shows no major signs of voltage instability.

‚öôÔ∏è Current Load Behavior
The current values (CurrentL1, CurrentL2, CurrentL3) followed expected patterns, with minor variations between the three phases. The cleaned data ensures that any extreme or faulty readings have been removed, allowing us to clearly observe how the load is distributed across the phases. This is important for detecting phase imbalance, which can affect equipment performance and power quality.

## Secondary Exploration Data Analysis 
After cleaning the dataset, we dove into exploratory data analysis (EDA) to better understand the behavior and relationships between key electrical features‚Äînamely active power, voltage (L1‚ÄìL3), and current (L1‚ÄìL3). These insights will help us in later modeling steps like feature extraction and forecasting.

## üìåSummary Statistics
We started with basic summary statistics to get a feel for the data range and distribution.

Datetime entries span from July 2023 to March 2025, providing a solid timeline for time series forecasting.

Active Power ranges from 0 to 106 kW, with a median of 5 kW.

Voltage across all three lines (L1, L2, L3) is fairly consistent, centered around 252‚Äì254 V.

Current values are more variable, with maximums reaching over 300 A on some phases, hinting at high load demands.

## üîç Pairwise Scatter Plots
We generated pairwise scatter plots to observe relationships between all combinations of features.
This helped in identifying:

Correlations, such as between voltage and current

Clusters or outliers, which may influence model training later

Linear or nonlinear patterns, which guide model selection

## üì¶ Boxplots
Boxplots provided a quick visual for spotting:

Skewed distributions

Outliers that were missed during z-score filtering

Comparison of feature ranges (e.g., Voltage vs Current)

## üìà Histograms
Histograms showed the distribution shape of each variable:

Some features like voltage had a narrow, symmetrical spread

Others like current had right-skewed distributions, showing occasional high spikes in load

These insights are useful for normalizing and selecting proper transformations before modeling.

## üî∫ 3D Scatter Plots
We visualized Active Power vs. Voltage vs. Current in 3D scatter plots for each phase (L1, L2, L3).
These plots:

Helped us understand how these core features interact

Suggested phase-wise differences in current draw

Revealed nonlinear relationships that may benefit from advanced ML models (like SVM or neural networks)

## üìà Correlation Analysis
We began by calculating the correlation matrix for all numeric features (excluding Datetime). A heatmap was then used to visualize the strength and direction of these relationships.

Key Findings:

Active Power had a very strong positive correlation with all three current phases (L1‚ÄìL3), especially CurrentL2 (0.9949), indicating current values are reliable predictors of power consumption.

Voltage values were positively correlated among themselves, but negatively correlated with both current and active power ‚Äî typical behavior in power systems.

This analysis confirmed that Voltage and Current behave inversely, especially under high loads, aligning with expected electrical theory.

## üß† Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
To simplify the dataset while retaining most of its variance, we applied PCA on the standardized numeric features.

Steps Taken:

Standardized the data using z-score normalization

Applied MATLAB‚Äôs pca() function to extract principal components

Generated visualizations for variance, score plots, and feature contributions

üîç Key Insights:
PC1 and PC2 together explained over 99% of the total variance, indicating that the dataset is highly compressible

The Pareto chart helped us understand how much variance each principal component contributed

2D and 3D PCA plots showed clear structure and separability in the data

The PCA biplot revealed that Active Power and Currents dominate PC1, while Voltage variables contributed more toward PC2

## üõ†Ô∏è Feature Engineering
We created new features that capture time patterns and power behavior:

Hour of the day: To track daily usage trends

Day of the week: To observe weekly demand patterns

Total current: Combined current from all three phases

Lag feature: Active power from the previous time step

Rolling average: Smoothed average of active power over 3 time steps

Target variable: Active power one step ahead (for supervised learning)

These features help the model understand when and how much power is typically used.

## üìà Feature Exploration
We removed rows with missing values (caused by lag/rolling calculations) and then explored the relationships between the engineered features.

‚úÖ Summary Statistics
Hour ranged from 0 to 23, confirming coverage across the day

Total current peaked at over 890 A, highlighting some heavy usage spikes

Rolling averages and lag features were aligned closely with current power behavior

üîç Correlation Matrix
We analyzed correlations to find the most predictive features.

Highlights:

Lag features and rolling averages were highly correlated with current power

Hour showed a weak to moderate correlation, which is still useful for pattern learning

Current total had a strong positive correlation with power-related features

A heatmap helped visualize these relationships quickly.

## üìä Visualizations
We used several plots to inspect feature behavior:

Pairwise scatter plots showed strong linear relationships between power, current, and engineered features

Boxplots highlighted value ranges and helped spot potential outliers

Histograms revealed the distribution of each feature ‚Äî useful for deciding on scaling or transformations
